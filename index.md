## About Me

I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. in Computer Engineering at the University of Pittsburgh, advised by Dr. [<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DSkE5P0AAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Ye Ye</a>]. My research focuses on transfer learning and domain generalization. Before embarking on my Ph.D. journey, I earned my honors bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Technology from the University of Science and Technology of China.

<!--
